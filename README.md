This is the Dashboard assignment for The Odin Project! 

This Admin Dashboard was made with HTML, CSS, and a teensy bit of JS for enabling dark/light mode. This project was built in order to apply knowledge of CSS grid that has been taught in the Odin Project curriculum thus far. Currently, the webpage is partially responsive for different browser sizes. Full responsiveness for mobile friendliness will be developed in the future.
